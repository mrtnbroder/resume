      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Dillinger.io is a side-project of Joe McCann, a Node.js developer, Cofounder/CEO of nodesource, Futurist, Minimalist and Capitalist from New York. He built Dillinger.io in the need of a decent markdown editor with a live preview. Today, it has over 50.000 page views the month and over 3.000 stars on GitHub.</p>
      <p>He asked for Redesign and UX improvements, since it looked outdated and desperatly needed a refreshment. It was a requirement to use a Open Source HTML, CSS and JS framework like Bootstrap, so people could easily contribute.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I've began studying the shortcomings of the existing site and started to write down what could be improved, removed or changed. After I made my impression, I started with some research and brainstorming first, finding out how other competitors compare to it. After doing that, I started doing rough sketches of the ideas I had. When I think I got a good sketch, I improve upon that and create wireframes for a more detailed impression.</p>

      <!-- Digging deeper -->
        <h2>Digging deeper</h2>
        <p>I used a great online app called LayerVault for the presentation of my wireframes, it is a great helper for designers as the client can easily comment directly on the designs, simply by clicking and dragging on the picture and writing down his thoughts.</p>
        <p>When all the details were settled, I started on the actual design. Going Mobil-first, I started by crafting the mobile pages first, followed by the tablet pages and at last, the desktop ones.</p>

      <h2>Prototyping for the look &amp; feel</h2>
      <p>I wanted to show a great presentation of my designs, and what is the best way of doing that? Right.<br> A <del><em>printed, cut out and combined, mobile phone camera filmed</em></del> interactive prototype of course! I started to export the pages (I love how fast and easy it is with Sketch App to export images) to upload them on InVison, an awesome online prototyping web-app. Within a matter of minutes, I've had a working prototype of the app, easily sent to my client with the click of a button.</p>
      <p>One "Awesome!" later, I've had my confirmation to get on to my next step.</p>

    <h2>The Coding</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.</p>
      <span>â€“ S. McConnell</span>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="container">
      <p>It is always a challenge, working into someone elses codebase, especially when nothing is commented or documented. For my luck, the code was greatly written and most functions had comments, it didn't take me long and I started to implement my stuff on top of it.</p>
      <p>Dillinger has a quite complex structure and most of it's functions were self-written. As I thought that this complex nature could be made less stressfull for others, I decided to implement AngularJS into it. It has a big userbase and many can contribute to Dillinger to improve it even more.</p>
